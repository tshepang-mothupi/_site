## Directory Structure

This project follows a structured directory layout to organise input
materials, generated outputs, and temporary files efficiently.

- **`_reference/**: Static documents that are not generated by analyses,
  such as assignment questions and reference materials.
- **`_raw_data/**: Raw, unprocessed data files.
- **`docs/**: Rendered documents produced from R Markdown (`Rmd`) or
  Quarto (`qmd`) scripts.
- **`_output/**: Final analysis results, processed data, and exported
  reports.
- **`_tmp/**: Temporary storage for cached outputs, intermediate
  results, and shared files.
