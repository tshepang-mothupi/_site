# STATISTICAL COMPUTING

## Overview

This Quarto project contains solutions to the practical questions outlined below. Each practical is answered in its own \`.qmd\` file, and the project is hosted on GitHub for peer assessment.

The following practicals are included:

\- [Practical One](prac-day-1.qmd): Data exploration and linear regression using matrix calculations.

\- [Lowess Practical](prac2.qmd): Implementing and comparing locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (Lowess).

\- [Practical Day Five](prac-day-four.qmd): Data visualization exercises using \`ggplot2\` and \`palmerpenguins\`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Practical One

This practical involves fundamental data exploration and regression techniques:

1\. Identify rows in the \`airquality\` dataset with missing values.

2\. Compute the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for temperature and ozone levels.

3\. Perform linear regression using matrix calculations and compare results with \`lm()\`.

Refer to [Practical One](prac-day-1.qmd) for detailed solutions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lowess Practical

This section introduces Lowess smoothing, a non-parametric regression technique:

1\. Understand the Lowess algorithm and its steps (data selection, span, weighting, regression).

2\. Implement a custom Lowess function in R.

3\. Compare the custom implementation with Râ€™s built-in \`lowess()\` function.

4\. Visualize and compare the smoothed outputs.

Refer to [Lowess Practical](prac2.qmd) for implementation details.

## Practical Day Five

This practical focuses on visualization techniques:

1\. Simulate and plot a normal distribution using \`ggplot2\`, overlaying the true density function.

2\. Generate a well-formatted two-way frequency table of penguin species and island locations.

3\. Plot flipper length distributions using boxplots, density plots, and faceted views.

Refer to [Practical Day Five](prac-day-four.qmd) for detailed solutions.
